# Wolt Internship Assignment â€“ API Endpoint for Distance & Pricing Calculations
This repository contains a backend API endpoint developed as part of the Wolt internship assignment. It provides an API endpoint that retrieves data from multiple internal APIs, performs coordinate-based distance calculations, and computes pricing based on predefined factors. The detailed specifications for this endpoint are found [here](https://github.com/emarkula24/backend-internship-2025).

**Note:** The internal APIs provided for this assignment may no longer be functional.
